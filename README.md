Hi, everyone! I'm Shen Ziming. This is my first repository of Github.
I hope that I can get used to this great tool.

The recent changes, which include LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, are all about my course assignments in Open Source Software Development. I use this repository to do my assignment 1. The LICENSE is MIT License. The CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT file is according to this template which is given by PurpleBooth, https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426#contributing.
